# concerto-rs

A parser for [Concerto](https://github.com/accordproject/concerto) modeling language, written in Rust.

It's not an official parser, neither is it complete. I am learning [pest](https://pest.rs/) PEG library by applying it to Concerto.

Previous attempt to implement the parser in nom is parked in another repo [here](https://github.com/ekarademir/concerto-nom).
